# PaichanPay

PaichanPay is a mashup project inspired by popular apps like Hamro Patro, Nagarik App, and digital wallets. It combines personal identity, document management, calendar, and future transaction features in one platform.

The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework. The frontend will be developed using Next.js.

## Project Structure

The project uses a modular Django structure. Major apps are organized under `src/apps/`, such as:

- users: handles authentication
- profiles: personal details and QR code
- documents: identity files like citizenship, PAN, etc.
- calendar: events and reminders
- transactions: future support for wallet and payments

## Status

The project is under development and not yet ready for production use.
